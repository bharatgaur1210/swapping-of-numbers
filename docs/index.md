## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/bharatgaur1210/swapping-of-numbers/edit/main/docs/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

#include<stdio.h>
int main() {
  double first, second, temp;
  printf("Enter first number: ");
  scanf("%lf", &first);
  printf("Enter second number: ");
  scanf("%lf", &second);

  // value of first is assigned to temp
  temp = first;

  // value of second is assigned to first
  first = second;

  // value of temp (initial value of first) is assigned to second
  second = temp;

  // %.2lf displays number up to 2 decimal points
  printf("\nAfter swapping, first number = %.2lf\n", first);
  printf("After swapping, second number = %.2lf", second);
  return 0;
}

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/bharatgaur1210/swapping-of-numbers/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
